# **Professional Course Notes Open Source BUPT**  [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)](https://github.com/chiangtau/Professional-Course-Notes-Open-Source-BUPT/blob/main/LICENSE) 

Hello, there! Welcome to this repository, which provides most of the undergraduate course notes of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, created by [@chiangtau](https://github.com/chiangtau). You can use the **completely open-source & free** notes here. The formats provided by this repository include GoodNotes and PDF versions. Due to the limitation of Github, when the file size is less than 100M, it can be downloaded directly from the repository. If the file is larger than 100M, it can be opened through the link of Google Drive.

## **Before Using**
-------------
1. You need to download GoodNotes or PDF viewer first (Adobe Acrobat is recommended). Click on the image below the pages to jump to the corresponding website.
2. Due to my limited ability, mistakes are inevitable in the notes. You can discuss in the issue and indicate the source.
3. Any documents involved in this project are strictly prohibited for commercial use and homework submission.
4. I respect every contributor (including teachers), please contact me if there are slides or other materials you made in your notes.
5. Some notes are not finished, you are welcome to continue to write, you can contact me to upload the repo after completion. You will also appear in the contributors.
6. The language of all notes is zh-CN (unless otherwise specified).
7. Differences in majors may result in a different focus of a course. If you think note-taking is too simple, you can learn more.
